Solving exercises using basic operations
The study of mathematics is essential in gaining critical problem-solving skills, as well as being a necessary tool in many career paths such as science, engineering and finance. Basic mathematics is a crucial aspect of this and forms the foundation of all mathematical learning. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are the basic operations of mathematics. They are the starting points for all mathematical problem solving.
This project contains the solution of some mathematical problems assigned by the programme Software Analysis and Development Technology of SENA.
The main idea is to allow the dynamic solution of each exercise and to display the solution on the console. However, it is also designed to allow the input of data other than the problems, so that it acts as a sort of calculator.
